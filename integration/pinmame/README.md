# PINMAME DmdDevice.dll driver for pin2dmd users and freezy dmd-extensions plugin for non pin2dmd users with pin2dmd approved devices

Either use the pin2dmd DmdDevice.dll standalone with a PIN2DMD device or the pin2color.dll together with a compatible build of Freezy Dmd-Extensions on virtual DMD or other pin2dmd approved devices. 
Depending on wether you have VPinMame.dll or VPinMame64.dll installed you need to install the contents of x86 or x64 folder in the zip package.
For installation just copy the contents of the folder to your vpinmame installation folder. You may be asked to overwrite a previous installation of dmddevice.dll.

For freezy get installation support here Dmd-Extensions https://vpuniverse.com/forums/topic/7504-new-version-dmd-extensions-with-pin2dmd-coloring-plugin-and-pac-file-support/
