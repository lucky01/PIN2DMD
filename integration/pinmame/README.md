# PINMAME DmdDevice.dll driver with optional freezy dmd-extensions as plugin for non pin2dmd users

Either use the pin2dmd DmdDevice.dll standalone with a PIN2DMD device or together with DMDExt.dll from Freezy on virtual DMD or other devices. 
Depending on wether you have VPinMame.dll or VPinMame64.dll installed you need to install the contents of dmddevice or dmddevice64 zip package.
For installation just copy the contents of the zip file to your vpinmame installation folder. You may be asked to overwrite a previous installation of dmddevice.dll.
If you previously used freezy DmdDevice.dll and want to keep your settings just keep your DmdDevice.ini.

Freezy dmd-extensions is licensed under GPL. Both dmddevice.dll and dmdext.dll (renamed to dmddevice.dll) can be used independently 
and are separate programs, so the license of the Freezy plug-in makes no requirements about the main program.
For pin2dmd users there is absolutely no need to install freezy DmdExt.dll. It is just provided as a optional service for non pin2dmd users.
In comliance to the GPL of Freezys dmd-extensions, the source of the version used can be found here
